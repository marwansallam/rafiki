  description:'The exhibit will include miniature scale models of well-known sites and places from our world, and fictional worlds, connected by train tracks and highways featuring all manners of transportation known to mankind – from horses and elephants to hot air balloons, jet planes and space shuttles. We will have a variety of scenes from various places around the world. Obviously as an American company and a New York venue there will be an emphasis on scenes from the US, but Europe and Africa and Asia will also be displayed, as well as lands that otherwise only exist in our imagination. All of them will be packed with a lot of “action,” surprises and humor. Inspired by New York City, our Metropolis exhibit celebrates scale and reveals the busy street life of our urban landscape. A city of light, Metropolis interprets the Empire State Building to Grand Central Terminal, Midtown to Downtown and everywhere in between. All the sights, skyscrapers, shopping, and scenery the Big Apple has to offer, are illuminated and revealed. The first stop on your tour through Gulliver’s Gate, Metropolis sets the stage for all to come. Our Asiana exhibit portrays the landscape of Asia as few have seen it. A diverse continent of majestic natural beauty, intricate ancient monuments and soaring feats of contemporary architecture and engineering, Asia offers limitless possibilities. Gulliver’s Gate unfolds Asia over half of a city block, creating a lasting impression of this diverse continent.',
